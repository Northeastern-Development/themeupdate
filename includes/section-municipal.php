      <p>Outside of the classroom, Northeastern helps the community in myriad other endeavors. Northeastern co&ndash;op students staff the <span>Mayor's 311 customer service hotline</span> to field city residents' non&ndash;emergency inquiries. The university's Facilities staff also manages <span>landscape improvement projects</span> at schools and parks around the city, as well as <span>snow clearing</span> and removal services to ensure public safety. Our academy&ndash;trained police force routinely supports Boston police with incident response in and around campus. </p>
