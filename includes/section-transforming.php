        <p>Since 2006, Northeastern University has invested more than $500 million to invigorate and transform the Columbus Avenue Corridor. This includes <span>$102 million to completely renovate and maintain the <a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2018/09/14/northeastern-reopens-historic-playground-with-a-state-of-the-art-upgrade/" title="click here to learn more about the william e. carter playground" aria-label="click here to learn more about the william e. carter playground" target="_blank">William E. Carter Playground</a></span> for the next 30 years. </p>
        <p>Northeastern donated its Camden parking lot, so the footprint of the park was increased by 25 percent. Updated features in the park include two football and soccer fields that can also be used for baseball, softball, lacrosse, and other sports. The park also has five tennis courts, open recreational space, and a "tot lot" area with equipment for children with disabilities. </p>
        <p>It also includes construction of the <span>$225 million Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Complex</span> and pedestrian skybridge that provides an important new link between the neighborhoods of Roxbury and the Fenway. An additional <span>$38 million has been invested to expand and refurbish Ruggles Station</span>. After purchasing and upgrading the Renaissance Park office building and garage, the university gave a <span>$175 million vote of confidence to the corridor with the opening of the International Village complex</span> in 2009. </p>
